      <!-- <p>You may have heard advice discouraging the inclusion of print statements in
functions that already do something else. It recalls the precept that pure code
should live apart from code that has side-effects; Haskell, for example,
enforces the segregation using its type system. Such rules are examples of the
more fundamental principle of
<a href="../25/separation-of-concerns.html">separation of concerns</a>,
and in this article we show, in Rust, how it can ease the control of logging.</p>

      <h3><a href="/2023/09/25/separation-of-concerns.html">Separation Of Concerns</a></h2>
      <!-- <p>If we were pressed to boil software engineering down to one principle, or to
identify the most important one of its best practices, we might well choose
<em>separation of concerns</em>. Its influence is seen at all levels of our craft,
from the “highest,” as in the division of a back end into a distribution of
single-purpose microservices, to the “lowest,” as in the splitting of an
overlong function into smaller ones. The operation is always the same: some
chunk of the system, sometimes a “confused” one, is broken down into pieces
that are then logically <em>composed</em>. And because these components are now
independent, they have become easier to test, easier to reason about, and
easier to improve.</p>
