    <h1>Separation Of Concerns</h1>
<p>25 Sep 2023 - awest</p>

<div class="post-body">
  <p>If we were pressed to boil software engineering down to one principle, or to
identify the most important one of its best practices, we might well choose
<em>separation of concerns</em>. Its influence is seen at all levels of our craft,
from the “highest,” as in the division of a back end into a distribution of
single-purpose microservices, to the “lowest,” as in the splitting of an
overlong function into smaller ones. The operation is always the same: some
chunk of the system, sometimes a “confused” one, is broken down into pieces
that are then logically <em>composed</em>. And because these components are now
independent, they have become easier to test, easier to reason about, and
easier to improve.</p>
